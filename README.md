# postgresql_project

This project aims to build and use relational database in PostgreSQL.

## The Business Case
The story: You are a database engineer employed by the Chicago police department. For quite
some time, the police have been investigating a gang of elusive bank robbers who have been
operating in Chicago district. They have collected quite a lot of information about the gang,
some from an informant close to one of the gang members. So far, they have been keeping the
data in a set of spreadsheets, but they realize that they cannot do many of the queries they want
in the spreadsheet and they are also worried that the data entry is introducing errors and
inconsistencies that the spreadsheet does not check for. From the spreadsheets, they have
produced a collection of tab-separated files of data. They now want you to convert the data into
a well-designed relational database and generate some standard queries.
